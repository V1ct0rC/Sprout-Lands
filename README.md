# Sprout-Lands
Game development project using PyGame. The main goal of this project is to learn how to use PyGame in a real and playable project. During my implementation I found a video tutorial on YouTube using the same assets I was using. So, I decided to follow the tutorial and implement the game using the tutorial as a guide, it helped me to organize and implement more efficiently. However, I hade to make some major changes due to updates in PyGame and in the assets (and some more stuff I wanted do impelement). The link to the tutorial is in the References section below.

This game will be named after the assets pack I'm using, Sprout Lands UI Pack, an amazing pack created by Cup Nooble. The link to the assets pack is also in the References section below.
